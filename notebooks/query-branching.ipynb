An automated procedure grouped the image pixels into spectrally 'uniform' segments. These were built around 'seedpoints' selected to avoid parcel boundaries. The segmentation recorded a field-by-field pattern, also separating land use zones within urban and suburban areas, and subdividing mosaics of semi-natural vegetation. Generalisation gave minimum mappable units of a half hectare. A 'vector' version was then created in the geographical information system (GIS), where the boundaries between the pixel-based segments were represented by digital linework.

The first band gives the most likely land cover type; the second band gives the per-parcel probability of the land cover, the third band is a measure of parcel purity. The probability and purity bands (scaled 0 to 100) combine to give an indication of uncertainty.

This vector Land Parcel dataset is the result of intersecting the 10m raster classified pixel datasets with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to generate summary land parcel attributes for each land cover parcel.

It is a three-band raster in GeoTiff format, produced by rasterising three properties of the classified land parcels dataset. The first band gives the most likely land cover type; the second band gives the per-parcel probability of the land cover, the third band is a measure of parcel purity. The probability and purity bands (scaled 0 to 100) combine to give an indication of uncertainty.  A full description of this and all UKCEH LCM2023 products are available from the LCM2023 product documentation.\\n\\n[TextChunk:textchunk_0063]\\n - content: classification results were validated against independently collected ground observations. All calculations were performed within a PosGIS database. Results were extracted from PostGIS using the QGIS export facility to give the final product as a SpatiaLite vector geodatabse.

Training data were automatically selected from stable land covers over the interval of 2020 to 2022. A Random Forest classifier used these to classify four composite images representing per season median surface reflectance. Seasonal images were integrated with context layers (e.g., height, aspect, slope, coastal proximity, urban proximity and so forth) to reduce confusion among classes with similar spectra.   Land cover was validated by organising the 10 m pixel classification into a land parcel framework (the LCM2023 classified land parcels product). The classified land parcels were compared to known land cover producing a confusion matrix to determine overall and per class accuracy. Details are available from the product documentation.

The series of LCM2007 products includes vector and raster formats, with a number of different versions containing varying levels of detail and at different spatial resolutions. \\n\\n[TextChunk:textchunk_0048]\\n - content: This dataset consists of a 25m resolution raster version of the Land Cover Map 2007 for Great Britain.

The dataset is part of a series of data products produced by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology known as LCM2007. LCM2007 is a parcel-based thematic classification of satellite image data covering the entire United Kingdom. The map updates and upgrades the Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) 1990 and LCM2000. Like the earlier 1990 and 2000 products, LCM2007 is derived from a computer classification of satellite scenes obtained mainly from Landsat, IRS and SPOT sensors and also incorporates information derived from other ancillary datasets.

In addition, it recorded \\n\\n[TextChunk:textchunk_0050]\\n - content: LCM2007 uses a spatial framework based on OS MasterMap (R). MasterMap was generalised to remove unnecessary detail, then the framework was segmented according to the underlying satellite data to split areas of non-uniform landscape. The data was classified according to a parcel-based supervised maximum likelihood classification procedure. The raster products are derived from the vector products. See online supporting information for further details. Version 1.2 includes the addition of OS tiles HZ and NW.\\n\\n[TextChunk:textchunk_0052]\\n - content: UKCEH\\'s automated land cover algorithms classify 10 m pixels across the whole of UK.

Level 2 & Level 3 attributes are available. Level 2, the standard level of detail, provides 26 LCM2000 target or (\\'sub\\') classes. This is the most widely used version of the dataset. Level 3 gives higher class detail. However, the quality of this level of detail may vary in different areas of the country, requiring expert interpretation. The dataset is part of a series of data products produced by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology known as LCM2000. LCM2000 is a parcel-based thematic classification of satellite image data covering the entire United Kingdom.

They give per-parcel land cover information in 21 classes based on UK Biodiversity Action Plan broad habitats. A UK spatial framework of land parcels (vector-polygons) representing real-world objects (for example: fields, lakes, urban areas and so forth) was intersected with the 20m Classified Pixels to generate per-parcel pixel statistics. These include a histogram recording pixel frequency per land cover class, the modal land cover class, the total number of pixels and three attribute indicators of classification confidence. Land parcel classification results were validated against independently collected ground observations. All calculations were performed within a PosGIS database.

It describes Great Britain\\'s land cover in 2019 using UKCEH Land Cover Classes, which are based on UK Biodiversity Action Plan broad habitats.  This dataset was derived from the corresponding LCM2019 20m classified pixels dataset.  All further LCM2019 datasets for Great Britain are derived from this land parcel product.  A range of land parcel attributes are provided.  These include the dominant UKCEH Land Cover Class given as an integer value, and a range of per-parcel pixel statistics to help to assess classification confidence and accuracy; for a full explanation please refer to the dataset documentation.  LCM2019 represents a suite of geospatial land cover datasets (raster and polygon) describing the UK land surface in 2019.  These were produced at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology by classifying \\n\\n[TextChunk:textchunk_0056]\\n - content: treated as GIS objects to which attribute data could then be attached covering such topics as land cover class, parcel area, length of boundary, processing history, knowledge-based correction and identification of the original satellite scene.
