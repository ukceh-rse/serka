## Description (excerpts)This is the land parcels \(polygon\) dataset for the UKCEH Land Cover Map of 2018\(LCM2018\) representing Great Britain\. It describes Great Britain's land cover in 2018 using UKCEH Land Cover Classes, which are based on UK Biodiversity Action Plan broad habitats\.  This dataset was derived from the corresponding LCM2018 20m classified pixels dataset\.  All further LCM2018 datasets for Great Britain are derived from this land parcel product\.  A range of land parcel attributes are provided\.  These include the dominant UKCEH Land Cover Class given as an integer value, and a range of per\-parcel pixel statistics to help to assess classification confidence and accuracy; for a full explanation please refer to the dataset documentation\.  LCM2018 represents a suite of geospatial land cover datasets \(raster and polygon\) describing the UK land surface in 2018\.  These were produced at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology by classifying satellite

LCM2018 represents a suite of geospatial land cover datasets \(raster and polygon\) describing the UK land surface in 2018\.  These were produced at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology by classifying satellite images from 2018\. LCM2018 was simultaneously released with LCM2017 and LCM2019\.  These are the latest in a series of UKCEH land cover maps, which began with the 1990 Land Cover Map of Great Britain \(now usually referred to as LCM1990\) followed by UK\-wide land cover maps LCM2000, LCM2007 and LCM2015\.  This work was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council award number NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK\-SCAPE programme delivering National Capability\.## Supporting Documentation (excerpts)a multi \-layer raster comprising spectral information  from a seasonal composite image and context  rasters\.  classification scenes are classified to yield a  pixel land cover classification\.   seasonal composite image  a multi \-band raster representing spectral observations  across four seasons\.  these are designed to provide  seasonal phenology  which a classifier can use to  differential vegetation types\.    ukce h aggregate land cover classes  a set of land cover classes that generalise the detail  provided i n uk ceh land cover classes\.    ukceh land cover classes  a set of land cover classes defined by ukceh, derived  from the uk biodiversity action plan broad habitats  \(jackson et\. al \. 2000\)   ukce h land parcel spatial framework  a polygon database of land parcel o bjects derived  from generalising national cartography in order to  remove unnecessary detail\.  all uk ceh lcm land
